*This is the incomplete openframe 2.0 which is now deprecated. 2.0 brings some OOP functionality to the MTA scene, but it isn't built for 1.4. We don't even know what it is last supported on.*

**Instead, use the latest openframe which can be found [here.](https://github.com/projectoraculum/openframe)**

openFrame is a fully OOP MTA framework.
It allows you to make your scripts cleaner and easier.
Inspired by GUIClasses, the original form of classes is easy to learn and use.
It uses advanced features of LUA and extends it.

Use it, when you want to:
=========================
 * *Make your code simpler*
  _With openFrame, your code will become simpler and easier to learn. It helps with sharing your resources with others._
 * *Make commercial projects*
  _You can sell gamemodes written with openFrame, because it's released under MIT license_
 * *Use other LUA*
  _Usually, LUA is function-based language. With openFrame, LUA becomes an OOP language!_
 * *.. and a lot of other things!*
  _openFrame is fully extensible, so you always can add your own classes to extend it._
