openFrame is a fully OOP MTA framework, scripted in Moonscript and ready to be built with Meta.py.
It allows you to make your scripts cleaner and easier to use.
Originially inspired by GUIClasses, the original form of classes is easy to learn and use.
It uses advanced features of Lua and extends its functionality

Use it, when you want to:
=========================
 * *Make your code simpler*
  _With openFrame, your code will become simpler and easier to learn. It helps with sharing your resources with others._
 * *Make commercial projects*
  _You can sell gamemodes written with openFrame, because it's released under MIT license_
 * *Use other Lua*
  _Usually, Lua is function-based language. With openFrame, Lua becomes an OOP language!_
 * *.. and a lot of other things!*
  _openFrame is fully extensible, so you always can add your own classes to extend it._
